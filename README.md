Just got out of the theater... echoes of the loud speakers still buzzing in my ears, like a jet engine that just won't shut up. Kimge kereksin—what did I even just watch?! My back feels like I've been squeezed into the jump seat for an international flight...ugh. Theater was chaotic, people chattering, dropping popcorn like confetti, tripping on the sticky floors, gross.

The movie, oh man, kept switching gears like it couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a drama, kinda like when you're serving fish or chicken and someone suddenly wants the vegetarian meal. Plot twists haphazardly tied together, like a mismatched uniform. I could barely keep up—it was like one of those turbulent flights where the seatbelt sign never turns off. Had to remind myself to breathe between scenes, like that scene in the cabin when the pressure drops.

> Some scene where the lead was running... Significance? Lost on me. But it had this frantic energy. Felt like rushing through customs with no time to spare. I swear, there was this random turtle...why a turtle? Symbolism? My brain's too fried to think. Might have to download the movie later, see if it makes more sense at cruising altitude.

I'm sitting here, tired as if I just finished a redeye, trying to connect dots that vanish like vapour trails. Someone asked me earlier to watch the movie. Bet they’re laughing now, knowing I’d be out here more confused than a passenger in the wrong terminal.

Anyway, here's a quote or moment, out of place like complimentary pretzels at a five-star dinner. Ah, who am I kidding—I'd take those pretzels right now, reached into my bag only to find crushed mints.

What was with that ending? Open to interpretation, I guess, like the direction of turbulence. But not in a satisfying way. More like when you find out the destination airport is fogged in and we're gonna have to divert.
